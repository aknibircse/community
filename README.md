## Getting Started

CHAOSS is an unusual open source project, in that we have a lot of sub-projects and initiatives. We are much more than code. As such, we highly encourage newcomers to the project to go through our [Quickstart Guide for New Contributors](https://chaoss.community/kb-getting-started/). This will help you get a better understanding of all the moving parts here.

## Join the Conversation

If you have questions, need help, or just want to talk about the project, [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/chaoss-workspace/shared\_invite/zt-r65szij9-QajX59hkZUct82b0uACA6g) is our main communication channel for the project.

Another good way to join the discussion is by filing or commenting on GitHub issues or pull requests in any relevant CHAOSS repository.

## Come to Meetings

Absolutely everyone is welcome to come to any of our meetings. You never need an invite to join us. In fact, we want you to join us, even if you donâ€™t have anything you feel like you want to contribute. Just being there is enough!

You can find details about our meetings on the community [calendar](https://chaoss.community/chaoss-calendar/). You donâ€™t have to turn on your video. Over time, we hope that you feel comfortable voicing your opinions, giving feedback on othersâ€™ ideas, and even sharing your own ideas, and experiences.

## Request a Tour Guide

CHAOSS has a program called our Tour Guides where a newcomer can request more 1:1 guidance for getting started and connecting with the group that is of interest to them. Simply reach out in the #newcomer channel of our Slack workspace and the Tour Guide Coordinator will get the ball rolling.

## Find an Issue

We have good first issues for new contributors and help wanted issues suitable for any contributor.

Sometimes there wonâ€™t be any issues with these labels. Thatâ€™s ok! There is likely still something for you to work on. If you want to contribute but you donâ€™t know where to start or can't find a suitable issue, you can reach out to us on Slack.

Once you see an issue that you'd like to work on, please post a comment saying that you want to work on it. Something like "I want to work on this" is fine.

## Developer Certificate of Origin Process

The CHAOSS project uses a Developer Certificate of Origin process for all contributions. Please visit our [DCO Setup](https://chaoss.community/kb/dco-setup/) Knowledge Base article for more details.
