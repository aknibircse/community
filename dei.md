# DEI Project Statement

### CHAOSS Project

CHAOSS prioritizes and reflects on DEI through a regular review of project policies and performance. This reflection is documented in the following DEI.md file based on specific [CHAOSS project](https://chaoss.community) DEI metrics.

### [Project Access](https://chaoss.community/?p=4953)
  
Project access is addressed in our project through various efforts. Through these efforts, we aim to support access for all. Specific efforts in our project include:

- All virtual meetings are transcribed via the Zoom annotation tool and members are able to join via their computer or phone. Video is not required to participate in virtual meetings.
- Virtual meetings are attentive to global time zones. While the majority of our meetings occur during times that are most easily accessed by members in North America, South America, Western Europe, and Africa, virtual meetings are also held to support CHAOSS members in Asia-Pacific and Eastern Europe.
- Global chapters of CHAOSS have been established in Africa, LATAM, Asia-Pacific, and Eastern Europe to support activities and people in a variety of global regions.
- Translation services are provided for all website pages.
- Our project regularly performs an accessibility audit on our website and project documentation.
           
### [Communication Transparency](https://chaoss.community/?p=4957)
  
Communication Transparency is addressed in our project through a variety of different efforts. Through these efforts, we aim to support transparency for all. Specific efforts in our project include:

1. All project documentation is publicly available via Google Docs and shared via our CHAOSS community handbook. 
2. Appropriate documentation is shared at the start of every working group meeting. 
3. Slack channels are regularly reviewed to determine if they should be public or private channels as well as considering if a channel is needed any longer. 
4. All virtual meetings are recorded and uploaded to our CHAOSS YouTube channel.
5. Decisions that impact the project are shared across numerous working groups meetings and associated Slack channels to ensure that as many project members can participate in the process.
           
### [Newcomer Experiences](https://chaoss.community/?p=4891)
  
The newcomer experience is addressed in our project through a variety of different efforts. Through these efforts, we aim to support the newcomer experience for all new members. Specific efforts in our project include:

- Newcomer events are held on a weekly basis in CHAOSS. These events include newcomer orientation sessions and office hours open to all with an interest.
- CHAOSS has a dedicated #newcomer channel on Slack where newcomers can join and learn about different ways to connect with the project. In the channel, we have a newcomer bot that provides detailed information on how to engage with the CHAOSS. The bot is available by typing ‘newbie’ in the #newcomer Slack channel.
- A quickstart guide for newcomers is posted on our website and made available through the main website navigation.
- Tour guides are readily accessible to assist new contributors to better understand the CHAOSS project and identify suitable areas where they can begin their contributions.

### [Inclusive Leadership](https://chaoss.community/?p=3522)
  
Inclusive leadership is addressed in our project through a variety of different efforts. Through these efforts, we aim to support leadership opportunities for project members with an interest. Specific efforts in our project include:

- The CHAOSS governance document is reviewed and affirmed on a yearly basis to identify and articulate roles within the project that help guide the strategic direction of the project.
- Global chapters of our project are led by people from those regions. Chapter leads help set the strategic direction of the CHAOSS Project as best suited in different global settings.
- Working group meetings provide the opportunity to be led by different people at each meeting. While each working group has identified ‘chairs’, leading a meeting provides an opportunity to lead for all members.

CHAOSS project recognizes that the inclusion of the DEI.md file and the provided reflection on the specific DEI metrics does not ensure community safety nor community inclusiveness. The inclusion of the DEI.md file signals that we, as a project, are committed to centering DEI in our project and regularly reviewing and reflecting on our project DEI practices.

If you do not feel that the DEI.md file appropriately addresses concerns you have about community safety and inclusiveness, please let us know. You can do this by reporting your concerns to our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/chaoss/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to raise concerns you have.
